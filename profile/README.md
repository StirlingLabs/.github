![Open Source at Stirling Labs](https://github.com/StirlingLabs/.github/blob/main/images/StirlingLabs.jpg) 

## Get Involved

We are building a lot of advanced technology but wherever possible we stand on the shoulders of giants so of course Stirling Labs proudly uses and contributes to open source software. We maintain a range of libraries and tools, providing source and high quality builds. See our [stirlinglabs.github.io](https://stirlinglabs.github.io) for details.

Right now, there are a range of excellent "good first issue" opportunities, if you're looking to get involved.
